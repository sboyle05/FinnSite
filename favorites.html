        <h2 class="mainstyle">Finn has tried and tested the following products and gives his toothy grin recommendation for them</h2>
        <ul class="list">
            <li><a href="https://store-us.babyzen.com/pages/yoyo2-stroller-birth"> YOYO2 Travel Stroller</a>- the ultimate stroller for globetrotting.
                So far Finn has wheeled his way on and off of airplanes. The only stroller allowed in overhead luggage
                everywhere you could want to go. It went up and down the cobblestone streets of Portugal with GRAND SUCCESS</li>

            <li><a href="https://www.guavafamily.com/products/lotus-everywhere-travel-crib">Lotus Travel Crib</a> making sleep anywhere a comfortable possibility. Like the YOYO2 the Lotus
                is also allowed in overhead luggage while flying. Whether exploring foreign countries or going to grandma's house, the Lotus is a winner!

                Bao Bao Learns Chinese
            </a> or Baby Learns Chinese is one of Finn's favorite books. Not only is he being exposed to Mandarin at such a young age, he's helping mommy and daddy, not get rusty.

                The Micro Mini Scooter
            </a> is a fun way for Finn to practice walking and moving around the house. It will also grow with him as he grows. It is designed to change with Finn as he goes from 12 months to 5 years.

            <li><a href="https://oreoriginals.com/collections/bibs-collection/products/fresh-messy-silicone-bib-spoon-set-puppies-poppies">This Silicone Bib</a>
            definetly was not one of Finn's favorite things from the start, but it sure is now. As Finn eats, it catches the food he drops and he is able to dump it all
        straight into his mouth later on during his feast. Mommy and Daddy just love how easy it is to clean after.
